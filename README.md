### Setup

This app can be viewed live on Digital Ocean's App Platform here: https://flowcards-xvz8u.ondigitalocean.app/

These setup notes are also specifically for working on my hackathon version of the app, so the MongoDB connection is pointing to my DB. Feel free to change that out for your own DB if you really want to run this app that badly ðŸ˜….

**Frontend:**
1. `cd /frontend/flowcardsUI`
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run dev`

**Backend:**
1. `cd /server`
2. `npm i`
3. Create a new `.env` file containing:
```
DB_USER=<your_db_user>
DB_PASS=<your_db_password>
```
4. `npm run dev`
